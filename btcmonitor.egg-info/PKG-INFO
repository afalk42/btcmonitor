# btcmonitor

A terminal dashboard (TUI) that monitors a local Bitcoin Core node using its JSON-RPC interface.

- Cross-platform: macOS and Ubuntu/Linux
- Single-binary dependency: Python 3.9+
- Uses cookie auth detection or `bitcoin.conf`
- Visualizes node health, mempool size/fee histogram, and a probable next-block outline (tx count, weight, fee rate bands)

## Install

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

```bash
btcmonitor --help
```

By default it auto-discovers the datadir and cookie file for the default network (`mainnet`). You can override:

```bash
btcmonitor --network mainnet --rpc-host 127.0.0.1 --rpc-port 8332 --rpc-user user --rpc-password pass
```

If `--rpc-user`/`--rpc-password` are omitted, cookie authentication will be attempted.

## Requirements
- Python 3.9+
- A running `bitcoind` with JSON-RPC enabled (default on loopback)

## Features
- Node summary: block height, headers, verification progress, peers, mempool bytes/txs, uptime
- System stats: CPU, memory, I/O
- Mempool visualization: fee buckets with ASCII bars
- Next block projection: approximate composition derived from `getblocktemplate` or mempool fees

## Quit
- Press `q` or `Ctrl+C`
